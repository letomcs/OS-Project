The focus of this part of the project is to use fork, PATH variables, and execv.
A lot of this comes from the skeleton given in the prompt from the assignment, 
the rest is just attempting to figure out what connects with what I am given at the start.
Overall, what it does can be diffcult to see originally, but over time, it can be self explanatory.
//Prologue
The vague runthrough or what main method does is grabs and parses every path in PATH into the array dir or directory.
That is where we will attempt to find commands.
Then, it sticks us in a while loop and uses readcommand to grab the input for the shell.
Parsecommand breaks it down by whitespace in minishell.h to individual pieces which go into argv[0].
Then, using lookup path along with the argv and dir arrays, 
then concats the string of argv[0] or the main command with other directories to see if it can be accessed/ if it exists in that directory
If it can be accessed in a certain directory, it allocates more space for the path and replace the original string in argv[0].
Unless the input is quit, a child process is ran that uses execv to run the command, where the first param is the command path, and argv entries until NULL are params.
Once the command completes, child informs us/the parent process that the process finished and is terminated.
Finally, once you type quit or enter ctrl+c, main method ends the loop and prints that it is terminating.
//WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
Ensure you have minishell.h as it has important values defined that are needed
Avoid using directory changing commands or text document commands like vi. the former is true, because it can't interpret '.' as it sees it as WHITESPACE
if you want to risk working with directory commands, remove '.' in whitespaces but i cant guarentee your safety.
The latter should be avoided, since vi and the gets command become finnicky and fight for input. You wont be able to enter :wq or :q
to leave, so you are forced to ctrl+c.
